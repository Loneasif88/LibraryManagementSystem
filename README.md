# LibraryManagementSystem
This Java-based Library Management System project is a comprehensive solution for efficiently managing library resources, streamlining book lending, and enhancing user experiences. It was developed as part of my internship at @CodeCasa and showcases my expertise in Java, JFrames, SQL, NetBeans, and Swing.
